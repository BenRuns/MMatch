	Most of our  team met through Jigsaw Renaissance, a Seattle makerspace. Our idea goes back to a proposal from Budi Mulyo in 2012 to create a one-stop shop for makers and makerspaces.

	As we move forward with this idea, we need people and organizations to provide feedback and create a marketing buzz. We are discussing our ideas and plans with makers, makerspaces and people and businesses that work with makers.
	We want to help Makers be successful.
